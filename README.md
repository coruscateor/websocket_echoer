# WebSocket Echoer

This is a WebSocket server which echoes messages that are sent to it.

## Coding Style

The coding style of this project emphasises the use of white space over keeping the line and column counts low.

So this:

```rust
fn foo()
{

    bar();

}

```

Not this:

```rust
fn foo()
{
    bar();
}

```

<br/>

This excludes auto-generated code.
